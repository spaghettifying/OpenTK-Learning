# OpenTK-Learning
I decided that I want to potentially learn OpenTK, and this will be my progress

I plan to first learn the basics of the OpenTK library, then move on to more advanced parts of it.

I wanted to learn OpenTK because I have previously used Unity2D, but I would like to try a more performance based graphics engine that can potentially handle millions of objects all moving at once. Learning OpenTK also allows me to experiment and learn about shaders, and hopefully some other advanced programming techniques.
